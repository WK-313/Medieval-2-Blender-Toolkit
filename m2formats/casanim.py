r"""Read an animation ``.cas``: which bones turn, and how, over time (Phase 55a).

A battle model's animations are ``.cas`` files too, under ``data/animations``,
and :mod:`unittransfer.cas` could not read one: it expects a chunk list right
after the node table, and an animation puts its key data there first. The
first file tried, ``engine/ballista/ballista_stand_to_crank.cas``, stopped
cas.py at byte 680 with a zero-length "chunk" that was really the start of a
quaternion. Nothing in ``Reference/`` documents the layout, so it was read out
of the bytes of DaC's 1 753 loose animation files, and every one of them is
held to it (``tests/test_casanim.py``).

What an animation file is
-------------------------
**The header is the model header**: version, length, node count, the parent
table, the key times, then a record per node. What an animation adds is what
each node's record carries after its name::

    uint32  rotation key count      0, or the file's key count
    uint32  position key count      0, or the file's key count
    uint32  rotation offset         byte offset of this node's rotations
    uint32  position offset         byte offset of this node's positions
    uint32  0
    string  the bone's properties   length-prefixed, NUL included

That last field is why cas.py calls this "25 bytes": in every soldier's file
the string is empty - a length of 1 and its NUL. DaC's siege engines fill it
with 3ds Max's physics notes ("Mass = 50.000000 ... Simulation_Geometry = 2"),
and read as a fixed 25 bytes that sent every node after it into the text.

**The offsets are into one block that follows the node table**: every animated
node's rotations first, 16 bytes a key (a quaternion, x y z w), then every
animated node's positions, 12 bytes a key. A node with no keys of a kind still
carries the running offset, so the offsets are checkable as a sequence and not
only as numbers. **Then the pivots**, three floats a node, and then the same
chunk list a model ends with, all of it empty, whose sizes must land exactly on
the last byte - or nothing at all: 220 of DaC's siege engine files and all 10
of ROCSS's end at their pivots (measured by Phase 57a's writer, which puts
every file back byte for byte).

**The pivots are AFTER the keys, and 55a had them before.** Both orders account
for every byte of every file, so every check above passed either way, and a
base pose (no keys) cannot tell them apart. What gave it away was drawing:
read before the keys, a soldier's idle has the pelvis quaternion repeated
through its "pivots" and every rotation read 252 bytes late, twelve bytes into
a key - which is why 55a found (1,0,0,0) and (0,0,0,1) both common as still
keys and could not say which component was w. Read after, the pivots are the
base pose's to three decimals and the first key of MTW2_Mace's idle is
``(0.052, 0.002, -0.000, 0.999)``: **w is last**, and every one of DaC's 1.23 M
soldier rotations is unit length to within 2e-7. The exporter does normalise.

**A position key is an offset from the pivot, not a position.** A soldier's
pelvis has pivot 0 and keys at its height (0.966 in MTW2_Mace's idle); every
other soldier bone keys zero and sits at its pivot. A siege engine's
destruction flings its wood chunks by keying a few centimetres from pivots a
metre out.

**Measured, 2026-09-23**: all 10 of ROCSS's loose files read, and 1 741 of
DaC's 1 753. The twelve refused are one siege engine, the Isengard ballista -
six files and a `convertedfiles` copy of the same six - and each ends twelve
bytes short: the keys are whole, the last node's pivot is missing and there is
no chunk list. Two of them are played by descr_engine_skeleton.txt.

**A base pose has no keys at all** - every count zero, the block empty - and is
the skeleton: node names, parents and pivots.
