"""Decode M2TW battle models (``.mesh``) to plain geometry the web UI can draw.

The format had to be read out of the bytes rather than out of a spec. Neither
reference we hold describes it:

* the Blender addon in ``Reference/Medieval-2-Toolkit/`` never parses a model -
  it writes an IWTE task file and shells out to ``IWTE.exe`` (``tasks/iwte_run``);
* the reference tool's ``src/lib/casCodec.js`` documents ``.mesh`` as "uint32
  version, uint32 submesh count, 32-byte vertices", which matches no real file.
  Its own comment ("attempting to parse anyway") is the tell.

What a ``.mesh`` really is
--------------------------
A **boost::serialization binary archive** - every file opens with
``16 00 00 00 "serialization::archive"``. Which means the byte layout is not a
flat struct: boost writes a class descriptor the FIRST time it meets a type
(class id, tracking flag, version) and only the class id on every later mention,
so the same record is two bytes longer the first time it appears. That is the
whole reason a fixed-stride reader cannot work, and it is what :class:`_Archive`
below exists to model.

The record layout on top of it::

    header, then a group count, then one record per group:
        string  group type        "Body"  "Head"  "primaryactive0"  "shield0"
        string  mesh name         "horse_body_01"  "saddle"
        uint32  triangle count
        uint16  index triples
        uint32  flag              0 required, 1 optional
    then the vertex pool the groups all index into:
        uint32  vertex count, then a stream per attribute:
        uint32  stream type, uint32 count, count * stride bytes
    then a bounding sphere and a bone table:
        uint32  bone count, then (uint32 name length, chars, uint32 index)
    then a per-LOD block, named but not decoded - see below.

**Indices are global.** Every group indexes one shared vertex pool, so a group
is a face range, not a mesh of its own. The variants a unit shows at random
(``horse_body_01`` / ``_02`` / ``_03``) are separate groups over that same pool.

**A model is painted from TWO textures GLUED SIDE BY SIDE, and its UVs address
the pair.** Its modeldb entry names a main texture and an attachment texture
per faction, and the game treats them as one image twice as wide: main on the
left, attachment on the right. **In the file, u is normalised over that PAIR**:
u 0..0.5 is the main sheet, u 0.5..1 the attachment sheet, and the pair tiles
with period 1. Measured, not assumed: across 900 models in one mod, 1,092 of
the 1,179 weapon and shield groups - the art an attachment sheet exists for -
sit in u 0.5..1, with bodies, heads and beards packed into 0..0.5.

Everyone downstream of IWTE speaks the DOUBLED version of that coordinate -
the Blender addon keeps main-texture objects in u 0..1 and attach objects in
u 1..2 (``export_checks.checkUVSpace``), because IWTE doubles u when it turns
a .mesh into a scene - so :func:`_read_streams` doubles u the same way and
everything this module hands out uses the community convention: main 0..1,
attachment 1..2, tiling with period 2. Nobody has to know the file stores it
halved except this docstring.

A renderer therefore does not choose a sheet, and must not: it glues the two
into one texture, samples at ``u/2`` with REPEAT wrapping, and the coordinate
does the rest. Choosing per group is wrong for the groups whose art crosses
the boundary (a barded horse's Body group spans both sheets), and normalising
a coordinate into 0..1 throws the tiling away. :func:`_classify_sheets`
records which sheet a group's art lands on for the sake of SAYING so; it is a
label, not an instruction.

**The models are left-handed.** Right is +X, up is +Y and forward is +Z, which
is the Direct3D convention and the opposite of OpenGL's. Measured, not assumed:
a horse's head sits at +Z and its tail at -Z, and on a soldier the ``shield0``
group sits at -X with ``primaryactive0`` at +X - shield in the left hand,
weapon in the right. Anything drawing these coordinates in a right-handed
viewer has to negate one axis or every model comes out mirrored.

**Models stand up the Y axis**, and nothing in the file says so. Measured rather
than assumed: across six Divide and Conquer soldiers the ``Head`` group's
centroid sits about 1.4 above the ``Legs`` group's in Y and level with it in X
and Z, and plotting a horse with Z across and Y up draws a horse. A viewer that
orbits the wrong axis lays every man in the game on his side, so it is worth
knowing before drawing anything.

Stream types, worked out by stride and by what the numbers turn out to be:

======  =======  =========================================================
type    stride   meaning
======  =======  =========================================================
0       12       position, 3 floats
1        8       bone weights, 2 floats (they sum to 1)
2        4       bone indices, 4 bytes
3        4 / 12  normal, either packed or three floats - see below
4        8       texture coordinates, 2 floats; u stored halved - see above
8, 9     4       colour and lighting channels, settlement meshes only
10      4 / 12   tangent, written like the normal
11      4 / 12   binormal, written like the normal
13, 14   4       two more settlement-only channels
======  =======  =========================================================

**There are two vertex formats sharing these type numbers.** A skinned model -
soldiers, mounts, settlements - packs the normal, tangent and binormal
D3DCOLOR-style: unsigned bytes biased around 127.5, z-y-x order, pad byte last
(see :func:`_unpack_normals` for how that was established). A static one -
siege engines, sky domes - writes the same three as three floats each. Nothing in a stream header
says which, so :func:`_resolve_stride` settles it by trying both and keeping the
one the rest of the file can be read from. The same split shows up in the
archive header, which is four words long for a skinned model and three for a
static one (:func:`_read_header`).

The weight and bone-index streams were read for the byte count and dropped
until Phase 55b, which plays a model's animations and so skins it: they are
kept on :attr:`MeshFile.weights` and :attr:`MeshFile.bone_ids`, and bone NAMES
are what tie the model to its skeleton. **A model's bind pose is the
skeleton's base pose with the pelvis at the origin**: a soldier's vertices sit
around their bones' pivots chained from zero, arms out in a T.
A settlement mesh under ``blockset`` is the same format with no bones at all; a
siege engine has a handful (``bone_Lwheel``, ``bone_Rwheel``).

How far the decode goes, and how we know it is right
----------------------------------------------------
Everything from the first byte to the end of the bone table is read as a
grammar: no searching, no strides taken on faith. Reaching the bone table at
all is the proof, because a single wrong stride anywhere before it - one index
block, one vertex stream - puts the table outside the short window it is looked
for in, and the count read there lands on nonsense instead of a bone.

What is NOT decoded is the block that closes the file: a per-LOD record of
material and attachment settings, 519 bytes in every unit model measured. Its
name is read (``characterlod0``) and its length recorded on
:attr:`MeshFile.trailer`; nothing the viewer draws is inside it, so decoding it
was not worth another round of archaeology. A trailer larger than
:data:`MAX_TRAILER` is treated as a decode that stopped early, not as a big
block.

The one place the reader searches rather than parses is the gap between vertex
streams, where boost's bookkeeping changes length depending on which classes
the archive has already introduced - see :func:`_find_stream`, which explains
what constrains the search.

``tests/test_mesh.py`` holds this to the reference models in ``Reference/`` and
to every model in whatever mods are installed. **4,700 of the 4,702 .mesh files
in Divide and Conquer and Third Age Reforged decode** with every invariant
holding - every unit model, mount, settlement piece and siege engine in both.

The two that do not are sky domes under ``globallighting``, and they are
refused rather than half-read: a file can hold SEVERAL models one after another,
and this reader takes a single-model file. The tell is the closing block - a
model that ends names it (``characterlod0``), and one followed by another model
has no name to give, which is how :func:`_finish` tells the two apart and says
which it found.

What a ``.cas`` is, and why there is no reader for one here
-----------------------------------------------------------
:func:`probe` tells a strat-map ``.cas`` from a battle ``.mesh``, and
:func:`read_mesh` refuses one by name rather than by crashing - but the
geometry is not decoded, because a ``.cas`` is not a variation on this format,
it is a different one. It opens with the float ``3.2``, and what follows is a
whole 3ds-max scene export: a frame rate and a table of key times, a node
hierarchy (``Scene Root``, then the bones), animation tracks over those nodes,
then the mesh, then the material and its texture - ``textures\\Daritai.tga`` sits
in the last 60 bytes of the file. Reverse-engineering it is a second job of the
size this one was, and it belongs to the campaign map's strat preview, which is
where the roadmap always had it.

**16k did it, in :mod:`unittransfer.cas`.** Every note above turned out to be
right, and none of it was the hard part: the file is a chunk list, the meshes
are one chunk kind of five, and a settlement is several meshes with a material
each rather than the single model this reader takes. What the two formats share
is the far end - :func:`geometry_payload` serves either, because
:func:`unittransfer.cas.as_mesh` lays a scene's meshes into one pool and hands
back a :class:`MeshFile`.

    A modeldb entry names two textures per faction, a main one and an
    attachment one, and **the game lays them out as ONE image twice as wide** -
    main on the left, attachment on the right - which is what the mesh's single
    UV set addresses. In the coordinates this module hands out (u doubled by
    :func:`_read_streams` from the file's pair-normalised form), u 0..1 is the
    main sheet, u 1..2 is the attachment sheet, and the pair repeats in both
    axes outside that. The Blender addon
    works in the same space: ``export_checks.checkUVSpace`` keeps main-texture
    objects in the first tile and attach-texture objects "in the tile one unit
    to the right", and its importer splits the imported materials into
    ``__main`` and ``__attach`` on the same line.

    Nothing here is a rendering instruction. A renderer samples the glued pair
    at ``u/2`` and the coordinate picks the sheet by itself; it must NOT choose
    per group, because a group's art can cross the boundary - 124 of this mod's
    groups do - and picking one sheet for such a group is wrong about half of
    it. Nor may it wrap a coordinate into 0..1: 112 groups have u below zero
    and 268 have v outside 0..1, and those tile on purpose.

    What this is for is the answer to "what does this part use", which the
    viewer's part list shows. It is worked out the way the shader samples - the
    half of the glued pair a coordinate lands in is ``u mod 2``, below 1 for
    main and at or above 1 for attachment - so the label cannot disagree with
    the picture about anything you could see.

    The range is pulled in by :data:`TILE_EPS` first, and that is not a fudge.
    Meshes routinely have an edge vertex a fraction over a boundary - the
    ``avari_horselords`` body runs to u = -0.004 - and the render does sample
    the far sheet's last texel column there, exactly as the game does. But it
    is one column under one vertex, and calling the whole body "both sheets"
    over it tells the reader something false about the part.
