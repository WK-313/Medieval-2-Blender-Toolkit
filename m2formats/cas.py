r"""Decode M2TW strat-map models (``.cas``) to plain geometry the web UI can draw.

Phase 15 read the battle models and said, at the bottom of :mod:`unittransfer.mesh`,
that a ``.cas`` is not a variation on the ``.mesh`` format but a different one, and
handed it to the campaign map. This is that job. Nothing describes the format:
upstream's ``src/lib/casCodec.js`` documents a ``.cas`` as "uint32 numVerts, uint32
numFaces, no magic header", and every real file opens with a float, so its spec
matches no file that exists. The layout below was read out of the bytes of the 484
strat, terrain, effect and missile models installed here and checked against every
one of them: **472 decode**, and the twelve that do not each say why by name -
six are stamped version 2.19 or 2.23 and lay their header out differently, three
are Third Age Reforged settlements whose own chunk size points past the end of a
chunk, two are zero bytes long, and one is a material chunk one byte short of
what it claims. Not one of them is a model this reader read wrongly and kept.

What a ``.cas`` is
------------------
A **3ds-max scene export**, and it is laid out as a scene rather than as a model:
a frame rate and a table of key times, a node hierarchy with a parent table, then
a **chunk list**, and the meshes are one kind of chunk among several. So there is
no single vertex pool and no single object - a settlement is several named meshes
with a material each, all in one file.

The file, in order::

    float32  version - 3.2 for most, and 2.19 to 3.21 across the installed set
    uint32   38, uint32 9, uint32 0        - constant in every file measured
    float32  the scene's length in seconds
    uint32   1, uint32 0                   - constant
    22 bytes scene settings: two RGB triples (light and ambient) and a count
    uint32   node count, uint16 pad
    uint32   parent index, one per node after the root
    uint32   key count, then that many float32 key times, starting at 0.0
    per node: uint32 length, name with its NUL, then 5 uint32 (rotation and
              position key counts, their offsets into the key block, 0) and
              the bone's properties string - 25 bytes when it is empty
    the key block, when a node has keys: 16 bytes a rotation, 12 a position
    per node: 3 float32 - the node's pivot, relative to its parent
    then chunks to the end of the file:
        uint32 size (the whole chunk, header included), uint32 kind, payload

**The two RGB triples are why the header looks misaligned.** Six bytes of colour
in the middle of a run of 32-bit fields puts everything after them two bytes off
the grid, which is why the node count sits at 0x32 and not at 0x30, and why two
pad bytes follow it to put the parent table back on the grid. Nothing here is
guesswork: :data:`NODE_COUNT_AT` is where the count is in every file from 3.02
on, and a 2.x file is refused by version rather than read at the wrong offset.

**The parent table is one index per node except the root**, and it reads exactly
as a skeleton: on ``shadow_staff.cas`` it gives bone_pelvis the Scene Root,
bone_Rlowerleg the bone_RThigh, and the three cloak bones a chain of their own.
That is the check that the header is being read correctly rather than plausibly.

The chunk kinds
---------------
Five kinds turn up, and every file has all five - empty ones included, which is
what makes the chain checkable::

    1  static meshes      2  skinned meshes      5  materials
    3, 8, 10             always empty in every file measured

An empty mesh chunk is 16 or 18 bytes - the 8-byte header, a zero object count,
and the chunk's own trailer - so a static model still carries an empty *skinned*
chunk and a skinned model still carries an empty *static* one. That is the tell
for which of the two a model is, and it is also how the trailer lengths below
were pinned down.

An object, in either mesh chunk::

    uint32 length, name with its NUL
    uint32 length, 3ds-max user properties with their NUL - usually just the NUL
    37 bytes (static) or 28 bytes (skinned): a flag and the object's quaternion
    uint16 vertices, uint16 triangles, uint8 has UVs, uint8 has colours
    uint32 bone index per vertex          - skinned objects only
    float32 position, 3 per vertex
    float32 normal,   3 per vertex
    uint16  index triples
    uint32  the material this object is painted with, or -1 for none
    float32 u, v per vertex               - only when the UV flag is set
    uint32  colour per vertex             - only when the colour flag is set
    uint32  0

**The material index is the field that was nearly missed.** It sits between the
indices and the UVs, reads 0 in three quarters of all objects, and would have
passed for padding - except that a settlement has three meshes and three
materials, and reading it as padding leaves nothing saying which wall gets which
texture. On ``evil_men_huge_city.cas`` it hands its four objects materials 2, 1,
3 and 0, in that order, which is not an order anything else in the file would
have produced. 31 objects across the installed set write -1, which is a real
value: they have no material at all.

**A model is painted from ONE texture, named in the file.** This is the plain
difference from a ``.mesh``, which addresses a pair of sheets glued side by side
and needs its modeldb entry to say which two. A ``.cas`` material carries its own
path - ``textures\#banner_symbol_wales.tga`` - so a renderer needs the file and
nothing else. UVs are stored as the renderer wants them, and are not doubled.

What is measured and not decoded
--------------------------------
The 25 bytes after a node's name, the 37 or 28 bytes after an object's name
beyond the quaternion, and the per-material tail past the two colours. They are
constant or near-constant across every file here, they are counted so that a
file that disagrees is caught rather than mis-read, and they are reported in
:attr:`CasScene.notes` when they do.

**A chunk that goes wrong loses that chunk and not the file.** Chunk sizes are
absolute, so the next chunk's offset survives whatever happens inside this one,
and :func:`_read_meshes` uses that: a mesh it cannot read stops that chunk's
list, writes the sentence into the notes, and the walk carries on. That is what
makes ``se_fort.cas`` name its problem instead of dying on it: it opens with a
``CaozSceneCustomAttribNode``, a 3ds-max attribute holder rather than a mesh,
whose record runs to a length nothing in the file states, so the fort behind it
is lost - but the file still says so, in one sentence, with its three materials
and its node read. **This is the one place a note means geometry is missing**,
and it is why :func:`as_mesh` hands the notes on to the page.

The animation tracks are a separate job (:mod:`unittransfer.casanim`), but a
model can carry one: **Phase 75 found 53 of ROCSS's models, its diplomat among
them, with a baked animation's key block between the node records and the
pivots.** Read as a fixed 25 bytes a node, their pivots came out of the keys
and the chunk list read as a size in the billions; they now decode, and every
file that read before reads exactly as it did.

The pivots place a skinned model's vertices (:func:`bind_world`): drawn as
stored, a character is its pieces piled on the origin.

    A ``.cas`` writes its texture the way 3ds-max saw it -
    ``textures\\NE_stone_castle.tga``, and some mods lead with a backslash -
    and it is relative to the folder the model is in, not to ``data/``. Three
    things then have to be forgiven, all of them measured on the installed set:

    * **case.** The castle names ``NE_stone_castle.tga`` and the folder holds
      ``ne_stone_castle.tga``. NTFS does not care and a zip on another machine
      would, so the lookup is case-insensitive by hand.
    * **the extension.** The game reads ``.tga`` or ``.dds`` and mods ship
      whichever; the vanilla strat folder holds both for nearly every texture.
      The game's own order is ``<name>.dds`` first, so ``walls.tga.dds``,
      and then the name as written. It never swaps the extension, so a bare
      ``walls.dds`` is not the texture and is not taken.
    * **nothing at all**, which is not an error: 31 objects have no material.

    And one thing has to be *preferred*, which is Phase 29's root. A mod's
    packer converts each ``.tga`` to a DDS named ``<name>.tga.dds`` and leaves
    the original truncated to nothing rather than deleting it, so the named
    file is there, is first in the candidate list, and is zero bytes. Measured
    on both installed mods: Divide and Conquer has 1,172 of them under
    ``data/models_strat`` and Third Age Reforged two, and 1,171 of the 1,174
    have their real DDS beside them under exactly that name. The three that do
    not are all named ``XXXX...``, the modders' own mark for a file they have
    switched off.

    So an empty candidate never wins over a later one that has bytes in it -
    taking the stub is how the strat viewer ended up drawing a bare cube. An
    empty file is still returned when it is the ONLY thing there, because
    "present and unreadable" is a fault the layers above now report and
    "absent" is not, and collapsing the two is the mistake this phase undid.

    **``<name>.tga.dds`` comes before ``<stem>.dds``**, and it used to come
    after. Four materials installed here have both, with different pictures
    in them: DaC's Amroth general drew plain steel grey because a bare
    ``amroth_general.dds`` that nothing names was taken over the
    ``amroth_general.tga.dds`` beside the stub. The model's own UVs say which
    one it was painted for: 16.7% of its triangles land on empty background
    in the bare ``.dds`` and 1.0% in the ``.tga.dds``, and Umbar's captain is
    27.3% against 1.9%. The other two (Umbar's general, ROCSS's Bulgarian
    banner) fit both alike. That is the engine's own rule for a stubbed
    ``.tga``, the name with ``.dds`` after it, and it is what
    :func:`unittransfer.icons` already calls a file's partner. Every one of
    the 7,927 materials that resolve to a file in the two mods paints.

    **And then the whole order became the game's**, the same day. A named
    ``.tga`` that is a real picture used to be taken ahead of the
    ``.tga.dds`` beside it, and the game takes the ``.tga.dds``: 864
    materials installed here have both with bytes in each (696 in Divide
    and Conquer, 168 in ROCSS, the francisca among them), and the viewer drew
    the one the game does not. The bare ``<stem>.dds`` is gone from the list
    too, because the game never looks there; one DaC material leaned on it,
    a Tauriel strat model in a stray ``models_missile/models_strat`` folder,
    and it now shows unpainted, as it does in the game.
